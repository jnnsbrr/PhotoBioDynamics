# PhotoBioDynamics
Small modelling project to simulate photosynthesis on a global scale (0.5Â° grid). Potential Outputs are Gross Primary Production (GPP), Net Primary Production (NPP) and Net Ecosystem Production (NEP). It is based on a modified version of the Farquhar approach (Schaphoff et al. 2019, Haxeltine and Prentice 1996, Farquhar et al. 1980). Where possible, it uses vectorization and parallelization to efficiently process currently (year 2020) available remote sensing products that are open access.
